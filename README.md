# jpg2mat
A MATLAB program that converts a dataset of images from .jpg to .mat files.

## Notes
Part of the  [iHGS-MHI-BLOCKS Algorithm](https://github.com/alvinlimfangchuen/iHGS-MHI-BLOCKS) Custom Image Processing Algorithm for 3D Feature Generation.

## Getting Started

To clone this repository and start exploring the this image processing algorithm on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvinlimfangchuen/iHGS-MHI-BLOCKS.git
```

### Prerequisites

- **MATLAB**: Compatible with any version.
- **Dependencies**: No first-party toolboxes or third-party libraries are required for this algorithm.


### Dataset

The implementation of this project is based on the In-Air Hand Gesture Signature (iHGS) database, which is currently the only publicly available image-based dataset for in-air hand gesture signature recognition.
For more information on the iHGS database and to access it for your research, please visit the following link and contact the corresponding author:
